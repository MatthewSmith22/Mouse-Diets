# Mouse-Diets

This was an assignment for my Experiments and Sampling class. It is a one-way analysis done with ANOVA, a permutation test, and the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test. 

It uses the case0501 data frame from the Sleuth3 package. The data is from "The Retardation of Aging in Mice by Dietary Restriction: Longevity, Cancer, Immunity, and Lifetime Energy" by R. Weindruch, R.L. Walford, S. Fligiel, and D. Guthrie.
